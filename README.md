# Data Analysis Project

This project is a data analysis project conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. It utilizes various libraries such as NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
An exploratory analysis of the dataset was conducted to determine the performance class of the object based on 11 attributes. Various classifiers were tested, and clustering techniques were applied.
The project was carried out as part of the Fundamentals of Data Representation and Analysis course by a two-person team.
